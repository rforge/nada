All:
    o Handle NAs gracefully
    o Better method documentation

Ros:
    x cenros.print method is simplified ros.print
    o abline is broken
    o plot without plotting of points
    o points method
    o boxplot method
    o identify method
    o data that goes along for the ride and is printed in the as.data.frame
      (this will allow identify)

Cen:
    o flip factor should be larger than min

KM:
    o boxplot method
    o se(mean) to sd
    o a pretty plot method

    ! Why doesn't km.median == median for uncensored dataset?

MLE:
    o cenmle:
        cenmle.control = survreg.control
        cenmle-gaussian assumes a single-level grouping -- fix it

    o print method needs to handle strata

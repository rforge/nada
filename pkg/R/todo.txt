*** MAINT ISSUES

All:
    o Handle NAs gracefully
        o na.action method
    o Better method documentation
    o single-vector input

    o Fix cenxyplot

    o r-devel () adds dots to as.data.frame as.data.frame:

Ros:
    o abline is broken
    o plot without plotting of points
    o points method
    o identify method
    o data that goes along for the ride and is printed in the as.data.frame
      (this will allow identify)
    o the output data needs an index to get it back to original ordering

Cen:
    x flip factor should be larger than min 
       (!need to validate this change -- current fix may not work for log data)

KM:
    ? boxplot method
    - a pretty plot method

    ! Why doesn't km.median == median for uncensored dataset?
    ! data parameter doesn't get passed in cenfit

MLE:
    ! cenmle-gaussian assumes a single-level grouping -- fix it
    o print method like ROS and KM (n, n.cen, median, mean, sd)
        x depends on discriminating between models with strata
    o print method needs to handle strata
    o cenmle:
        cenmle.control = survreg.control

*** FEATURE ISSUES

MLE regression:
    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

ATS:
    o Intercept 
    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

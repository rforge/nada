*** MAINT ISSUES

All:
    o Handle NAs gracefully
        o na.action method
    o Better method documentation
    x splitQual = split_qual returns obs and censored vectors
    o single-vector input

Ros:
    x cenros.print method is simplified ros.print
    o abline is broken
    o plot without plotting of points
    o points method
    x boxplot method
    o identify method
    o data that goes along for the ride and is printed in the as.data.frame
      (this will allow identify)
    o the output data needs an index to get it back to original ordering

Cen:
    o flip factor should be larger than min

KM:
    o boxplot method
    x se(mean) to sd
    o a pretty plot method
    x pexceed needs to swap UCL and LCL.

    ! Why doesn't km.median == median for uncensored dataset?
    ! data parameter doesn't get passed in cenfit

MLE:
    ! cenmle-gaussian assumes a single-level grouping -- fix it
    o cenmle:
        cenmle.control = survreg.control
    o print method needs to handle strata
    x better print.summary.cenmle

*** FEATURE ISSUES

MLE regression:
    x return the correlation R (likelihood R, eq 11.4 pg 187)
    o check that the examples using the TCE dataset work correctly
    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

ATS:
    o work on porting issues using DL's code
        o return: tau (correlation coef), slope (m), intercept (b), p-value
    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

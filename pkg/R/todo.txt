*** MAINT ISSUES

All:
    o Handle NAs gracefully
        o na.action method
    o Better method documentation
    o single-vector input

Ros:
    o abline is broken
    o plot without plotting of points
    o points method
    o identify method
    o data that goes along for the ride and is printed in the as.data.frame
      (this will allow identify)
    o the output data needs an index to get it back to original ordering

Cen:
    x flip factor should be larger than min (!need to validate this change)

KM:
    ? boxplot method
    o a pretty plot method
    ? move survival stuff from cen.R to km.R

    ! Why doesn't km.median == median for uncensored dataset?
    ! data parameter doesn't get passed in cenfit

MLE:
    ! cenmle-gaussian assumes a single-level grouping -- fix it
    o print method like ROS and KM (n, n.cen, median, mean, sd)
    o print method needs to handle strata
    o cenmle:
        cenmle.control = survreg.control

*** FEATURE ISSUES

MLE regression:
    o check that the examples using the TCE dataset work correctly

    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

ATS:
    x work on porting issues using DL's code
        o return: tau (correlation coef), slope (m), intercept (b), p-value

    o plotting routine (scattered data and regression)

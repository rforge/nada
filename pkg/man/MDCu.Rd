\description{
Copper concentrations in ground water from the Alluvial Fan zone in
the San Joaquin Valley of California.  One observation was altered to
become a <21, larger than all of the detected observations (the largest
detected observation is a 20).

Objective is to calculate summary statistics when the largest observation
is censored.

There are five detection limits, at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ug/L.
An additional artificial detection limit of 21 was added to illustrate
a point.  Used in Chapter 6 of the NADA book.

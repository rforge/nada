\title{
    Compute Kendall's tau correlation coefficient and associated 
    line for censored data.
}
\description{
    Computes Kendall's tau for singly (y only) or doubly (x and y)
    censored data.  Computes the Akritas-Theil-Sen nonparametric line.

\usage{
    cenken(x, xcen, y, ycen)
    cenken(x, y, ycen)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{
    A numeric vector of observations.
} 
\item{xcen}{
    A  logical vector indicating TRUE where an observation in x is
    censored (a less-than value) and FALSE otherwise.  Can be 
    missing/omitted for the case where x is not censored.
}
\item{y}{
    A numeric vector of observations.
}
\item{ycen}{
    A logical vector indicating TRUE where an observation in y is
    censored (a less-than value) and FALSE otherwise.  
}
}
\details{
    Kendall's tau is a nonparametric correlation coefficient measuring
    the monotonic association between y and x.  For left-censored data,
    concordant and discordant directions between x and y are measured
    whenever possible.  So with increasing x values, a change in y
    from <1 to 10 is an increase (concordant).  A change from a <1 to
    a detected 0.5 is considered a tie, as is a <1 to a <5, because
    neither can definitively be called an increase or decrease.  Tie
    corrections are employed for the variance of the test statistic
    in order to account for the many ties when computing p-values.
    The ATS line is the slope that results in a Kendalls tau of 0
    for correlation between the residuals, y-slope*x and x.  Cenken
    performs an iterative bisection search to find that slope.  The
    intercept is the median residual (not yet implemented).

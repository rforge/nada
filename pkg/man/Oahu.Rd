\description{
Arsenic concentrations (ug/L) in an urban stream, Manoa Stream at Kanewai
Field, on Oahu, Hawaii.

Objective is to characterize conditions by computing summary statistics.

There are three detection limits, at 0.9, 1, and 2 ug/L.  Uncensored
values reported below the lowest detection limit indicate that informative
censoring may have been used, and so the results are likely biased high.
Used in Chapter 6 of the NADA book.
